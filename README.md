# Havoc Festival Creation - Magic the Gathering Battle Skill for Alexa
This is a Havoc Festival created skill for use of Alexa devices to lend a creative spin for MTG (Magic: The Gathering) games that range from 2 - 8 players.  Through this skill users will be given different battle scenarios that they can participate in with other players together.  To ensure that you get the maximum use for this skill it is advised that each player have their own Magic: The Gathering playing deck and this skill (of course).  Additional rules for any altered game setting will be covered by Alexa.

### Skill Features

* Main Menu navigation
* Games that support between 2 - 8 players.
* 13 Different types of game play depending on team size.
* Rules surrounding game build.
* Element play which includes: Standard, Vanguard, Planechase, and much more!
* Team variant styles of play: Archon, Headed Giant, Formation
* Game challenges: Hydra Attack, The Horde, Xenagos

**Note:** Some of the set rules are created in-house game variants created by the Havoc Festival's current Friday Night MTG group, so some creative assembly may be required to have the game function properly for your own play group.

## Required Items
In order to run this skill you will need the list of things below.  Feel free to makes changes to it as you see fit for your own MTG play.

* An Alexa Device with acocunt services to [AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) and [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/).
* Knowledge of [JS](https://www.javascript.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) will be very useful if you wish to continue to edit this in the current syntax format.  I also recommend [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as there will be several npm packages used in the creation of this application.

* Finally, and maybe most importantly you'll need Magic: The Gathering decks to use.
